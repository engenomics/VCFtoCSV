# VCFtoCSV
Converts a VCF to a matlabbable CSV.

In the main method of the class, run first the convertToExcel() method. Then, run the convertGapToExcel() method. Make sure to specify the input VCF file path, and also make sure to specify the output CSV file path. This path must be modified between the running of the two methods. Finally, specify the file path for the non-SNP csv.
